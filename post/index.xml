It was announced to the public in November 2009
Go is a statically typed, compiled language. It was aimed to improve programming productivity.
It has syntactic similarity to C, but includes memory safety, garbage collection, static typing, readability and built-in concurrency support.
It has simple, consistent features, which prefer maintainability over expressiveness.
Why Go? It is Open Source, Free and Cross-platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
